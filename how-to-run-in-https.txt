This tutorial is based on

https://codewithhugo.com/docker-compose-local-https/
https://github.com/HugoDF/docker-compose-local-https
https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert
https://hub.docker.com/r/jwilder/nginx-proxy/

Install mkcert
https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#installation

run "mkcert -install"
run "mkcert your-domain.local"

It will generate the certificate "./your-domain.local.pem" and the key at "./your-domain.local-key.pem"

rename "./your-domain.local.pem" to "your-domain.local.crt"
rename "./your-domain.local-key.pem" to "your-domain.local.key"

and move it to ./docker/jwilder-nginx-proxy-latest/certs

change VIRTUAL_HOST={your-domain.com} with VIRTUAL_HOST=your-domain.local in docker-compose.dev.yml

Restart the container (Stop the Docker Compose and Run It Again)
