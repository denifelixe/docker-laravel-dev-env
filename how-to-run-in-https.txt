This tutorial is based on

https://codewithhugo.com/docker-compose-local-https/
https://github.com/HugoDF/docker-compose-local-https
https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert
https://hub.docker.com/r/jwilder/nginx-proxy/

# Create docker-compose.dev.yml
    Copy docker-compose.dev.yml.example.https to docker-compose.dev.yml

# Set Up Domain
    # if you want to use https:// you need to setup the domain name, go to
    # Windows (C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts)
    # Linux/BSD/MacOS (/etc/hosts)
    # add to your hosts file
        127.0.0.1       your-domain.local
        # If you use Docker Toolbox that running Linux VM in background then the IP is 192.168.99.100
        192.168.99.100	your-domain.local
    # And Access it later in your browser with your-domain.local after you run Docker Compose

Install mkcert
https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#installation

run "mkcert -install"
run "mkcert your-domain.local"

It will generate the certificate "./your-domain.local.pem" and the key at "./your-domain.local-key.pem"

rename "./your-domain.local.pem" to "your-domain.local.crt"
rename "./your-domain.local-key.pem" to "your-domain.local.key"

and move it to ./docker/jwilder-nginx-proxy-latest/certs

change VIRTUAL_HOST={your-domain.com} with VIRTUAL_HOST=your-domain.local in docker-compose.dev.yml

Restart the container (Stop the Docker Compose and Run It Again)
